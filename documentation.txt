Number of Instances: 2205

Number of Attributes: 43680 (8x60 (1 Hz) + 2x600 (10 Hz) + 7x6000 (100 Hz))

Attribute Information:
   Attributes are sensor data (all numeric and continuous) from measurements taken at the same point in time, respectively, of a hydraulic test rig's working cycle.
   The sensors were read with different sampling rates, leading to different numbers of attributes per sensor despite they were all exposed to the same working cycle.
   
   1. Pressure sensors (PS1-6): 100 Hz, 6000 attributes per sensor (6 sensors)
   2. Motor power sensor (EPS1): 100 Hz, 6000 attributes per sensor (1 sensor)
   3. Volume flow sensors (FS1/2): 10 Hz, 600 attributes per sensor (2 sensors)
   4. Temperature sensors (TS1-4): 1 Hz, 60 attributes per sensor (4 sensors)
   5. Vibration sensor (VS1): 1 Hz, 60 attributes per sensor (1 sensor)
   6. Efficiency factor (SE): 1 Hz, 60 attributes per sensor (1 sensor)
   7. Virtual cooling efficiency sensor (CE): 1 Hz, 60 attributes per sensor (1 sensor)
   8. Virtual cooling power sensor (CP): 1 Hz, 60 attributes per sensor (1 sensor)

8. Missing Attribute Values: None

9. Class Distribution: there are 5 different class value vectors provided in profile.txt.
   All but number 5 (stable flag) describe degradation processes over time and, thus, their values do not represent distinct categories, but continuous values.

   1. Cooler condition / %:
      3: close to total failure (732 instances)
      20: reduced effifiency (732 instances)
      100: full efficiency (741 instances)

   2. Valve condition / %:
      100: optimal switching behavior (1125 instances)
      90: small lag (360 instances)

      73: close to total failure (360 instances)

   3. Internal pump leakage:
      0: no leakage (1221 instances)
      1: weak leakage (492 instances)
      2: severe leakage (492 instances)

   4. Hydraulic accumulator / bar:
      130: optimal pressure (599 instances)
      115: slightly reduced pressure (399 instances)
